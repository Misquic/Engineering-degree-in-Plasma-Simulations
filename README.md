# Computer simulations of plasma using the particle-in-cell method

This project started as project for my engineering degree. Inspired by Lubos Brieda's book "Plasma simulations by example".
In chapters 2 and 3 I learned basics of simulationg plasma and it influenced my style of developing this Project.
After I Learned what is in chapter 4 of the book I took a different path from book and developed Direc-Simulation-Monte-Carlo Ionization (ch4/v2).
That all is in my thesis. Fascinated by Plasma, simulations and c++ I decided to further develop this project. My first focus were variable-weight DSMC and multithreading.
These two are implemented in ch4/v3. My ultimate goal is to implement excitations, de-excitations of atoms, FEM and some further optimisations including calculations on graphic's card.
